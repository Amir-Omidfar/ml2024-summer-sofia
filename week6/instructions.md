1. Create a Python program:

- The program asks the user for input N (positive integer) and reads it.
- Then the program asks the user for input k (positive integer) and reads it.
- Then the program asks the user to provide N (x, y) points (one by one) and reads all of them: first: x value, then: y value for every point one by one. X and Y are the real numbers.
- In the end, the program asks the user for input X and outputs: the result (Y) of k-NN Regression if k <= N, or any error message otherwise.
- The basic functionality of data processing (data initialization, data insertion, data calculation) should be done using Numpy library as much as possible (note: you can combine with OOP from the previous task).
- Name this program "module6_knn-regr.py" and upload it to the above-mentioned repo.
