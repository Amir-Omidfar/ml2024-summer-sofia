## Exam Topics:
1. Demonstrate the ability to design the ML pipeline for any given problem. It should consist (but not limited to) of the following sub-steps:
	- Clear ML task statement: inputs and outputs, type of the problem (Classification vs Regression)
	- Data collection strategy
	- Data preparation routines
	- Model and loss function design
	- Success metrics and eval procedure
	- Model selection approach (including ablations of hyperparameters)
	- Iterative process on model and data update (including tracking the possible future issues)
2. Demonstrate the deep knowledge of the following ML concepts:
	- ML History overview
	- Supervised vs Unsupervised vs Semi-Supervised Learning
	- Supervised Learning, types of models (high-level)
	- Input feature types and their dimensionality
	- Empirical vs Structural Risk and its Minimization
	- Overfitting vs Underfitting and methods to avoid them
	- Cross-Validation
	- Model Selection pipeline and why it is important
	- Classification vs Regression Problems
	- Classification and Regression loss functions
	- Classification quality metrics (including accuracy, precision, and recall)
	- Regression quality metrics (including MAE, MSE, and RMSE)
	- Binary vs Multi-class Classification
	- Micro- vs Macro- Averaging for Multi-class Classification
	- L1 (Manhattan) and L2 (Euclidian) norms (distances)
	- k-NN Classification
	- k-NN Regression
	- Linear Regression: Ridge, LASSO, and Elastic variants
3. Additionally, be able to compute auxiliary things like:
	- TP, FP, FN, TN
	- TPR, FPR, FNR, TNR
	- MAE, MSE, RMSE
	- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
	- Empirical Risk
	- L1 (Manhattan) and L2 (Euclidian) norms (distances), and simple equalities/inequalities based on them
